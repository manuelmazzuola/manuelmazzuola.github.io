The CKA* certifications exams are easy to ace if you use Kubernetes daily.  
It's quite important to get familiar with the K8s online documentation since it is the only documentation you can view.
To make sure you are comfortable with [https://kubernetes.io/docs/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/) search for GitHub repositories that contain CKA* exercises and
attempt to resolve them with the help of online documentation only.  

That is all I've done to achieve the CKA and the CKAD certifications.
